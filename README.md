#Angular 2 Media Browser

~~~~
This version includes some sample mp4 videos from NASA and is about 170MB, I'll be cutting the videos down to a few seconds in the next update to reduce the total size. I kept these in there as samples to make sure I can clone and run it in multiple environments.

A simple Angular 2 Application that reads in a json file with a list of videos, title, descriptions, etc and displays them for users to browse and watch.
